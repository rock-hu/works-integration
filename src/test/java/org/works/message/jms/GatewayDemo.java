/**
 * A simple bootstrap main() method for starting a pair of JMS Gateways.
 * Text entered in the console will go through an outbound JMS Gateway from
 * which it is sent to a JMS Destination. An inbound JMS Gateway is listening
 * to that same JMS Destination and will send the text to another Spring
 * Integration channel where it is handled by a service that simply converts
 * the text to upper case. The upper-case result is then sent in a response
 * message over JMS so that the outbound Gateway receives it as the reply to
 * its original request. At that point, the text is logged to the console.
 * <p>
 * See the configuration in the three XML files that are referenced below.
